1,"Source: Statistics Canada, Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health (CCHS), 2012; Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental Health and Well-being (CCHS), 2002."
2,"The Mental Health Survey covers the population 15 years of age and over living in the ten provinces. Excluded from the survey's coverage are: persons living on reserves and other Aboriginal settlements; full-time members of the Canadian Forces and the institutionalized population. Altogether, these exclusions represent less than 3% of the target population."
3,"All rates in this table are calculated excluding non-response categories (""refusal"", ""don't know"", and ""not stated"") in the denominator."
4,"The Mental Health Survey is partially based on a modified World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI). The WHO-CIDI is a standardized instrument for assessment of mental disorders and conditions according to an operationalization of the definitions and criteria of the DSM-IV. DSM-IV refers to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders used by the American Psychiatric Association. It is an internationally recognized classification of mental disorders. Mental conditions or problems are derived from a set of questions pertaining to the feelings, the symptoms, severity, the intensity and the impact relative to each of the measured disorders."
5,"Population aged 15 and over classified as meeting criteria for any of the measured disorders (major depressive episode, bipolar disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, alcohol dependence, alcohol abuse, cannabis dependence, cannabis abuse, other drug dependence (excluding cannabis), other drug abuse (excluding cannabis)) in their lifetime."
6,"Major depressive episode requires at least one episode of 2 weeks or more with persistent depressed mood and loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, accompanied by problems such as decreased energy, changes in sleep and appetite, impaired concentration and feelings of guilt, hopelessness, or suicidal thoughts."
7,"Bipolar disorder includes respondents who meet the criteria for bipolar I  disorder or hypomanic episode, which includes bipolar II  disorder. It is characterised by at least 7 days (or fewer if hospitalized) of exaggerated feelings of elevated or irritable mood plus a certain number and combination of other manic symptoms such as racing thoughts, talking more than usual, excessive spending, decreased need for sleep, increased pleasure seeking activity, or exaggerated self-confidence. Many people also experience at least one depressive episode."
8,"Generalized anxiety disorder is characterised by a pattern of frequent, persistent worry and excessive anxiety about several events or activities during a period of at least 6 months. Symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder include restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, shakiness, sleep disturbance (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep or restless, unsatisfying sleep), excessive sweating, palpitations, shortness of breath, and various gastrointestinal symptoms."
9,"Alcohol dependence is characterized by a recurrent pattern of use where at least three of the following occur in the same period of 12 month period: increased tolerance, withdrawal, increased consumption, unsuccessful attempts to quit, a lot of time lost recovering or using, reduced activities, and continued drinking despite persistent physical or psychological problems caused or intensified by alcohol."
10,"Alcohol abuse is characterized by a recurrent pattern of use where at least one of the following occurs: failure to fulfill major roles at work, school or home, use in physically hazardous situations, recurrent alcohol related problems, or continued use despite social or interpersonal problems caused or intensified by alcohol.  By definition, respondents who meet the criteria for alcohol dependence are excluded from meeting the criteria for alcohol abuse."
11,"Cannabis dependence is characterized by a recurrent pattern of use where at least three of the following occur in the same period of 12 month period: increased tolerance, withdrawal, increased consumption, unsuccessful attempts to quit, a lot of time lost recovering or using, reduced activities, and continued use despite persistent physical or psychological problems caused or intensified by cannabis use."
12,"Cannabis abuse is characterized by a recurrent pattern of use where at least one of the following occurs: failure to fulfill major roles at work, school or home, use in physically hazardous situations, recurrent cannabis related problems, or continued use despite social or interpersonal problems caused or intensified by cannabis use.  By definition, respondents who meet the criteria for cannabis dependence are excluded from meeting the criteria for cannabis abuse."
13,"Other drug dependence (excluding cannabis) is characterized by a recurrent pattern of use where at least three of the following occur in the same period of 12 month period: increased tolerance, withdrawal, increased consumption, unsuccessful attempts to quit, a lot of time lost recovering or using, reduced activities, and continued use despite persistent physical or psychological problems caused or intensified by drug use."
14,"Other drug abuse (excluding cannabis) is characterized by a recurrent pattern of use where at least one of the following occurs: failure to fulfill major roles at work, school or home, use in physically hazardous situations, recurrent cannabis related problems, or continued use despite social or interpersonal problems caused or intensified by drug use.  By definition, respondents who meet the criteria for other drug dependence are excluded from meeting the criteria for other drug abuse."

47,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) from 16.6% to 33.3% are identified as follows: (E) use with caution."
48,"Data with a coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 33.3% were suppressed due to extreme sampling variability and are identified as follows: (F) too unreliable to be published."
49,"The following standard symbols are used in this Statistics Canada table: (..) for figures not available for a specific reference period and (...) for figures not applicable."
50,"The confidence interval illustrates the degree of variability associated with a rate. Wide confidence intervals indicate high variability, thus, these rates should be interpreted with due caution. When comparing estimates, it is important to use confidence intervals to determine if differences between values are statistically significant."
51,"Percentages are rounded to the nearest tenth. Numbers are rounded to the nearest unit."
52,"For the 2012 dataset, the 2006 Census population counts have been used to produce the population projection counts. These counts are used to ensure that the Canadian Community Health Survey - Mental health survey weights and resulting estimates included in this CANSIM table are consistent with known population totals. For 2002, 1996 Census population counts were used. Evaluation studies have confirmed that the impact of this change on CCHS estimates should be minimal."
53,"This variable provides direction and statistical significance of the difference between estimates (p less than 0.05). A value of +1 means the difference observed is significantly higher, -1 means the difference is significantly lower and 0 means the difference is not statistically significant."
54,"The 2012 data for 19 variables at the Atlantic Provinces and/or Prairie Provinces levels have been corrected. Data at the province and Canada level were not affected. The 19 corrected variables are: Any selected disorder (mental or substance), life; Any selected disorder (mental or substance), 12 months; Any mood disorder, life; Major depressive episode, life; Generalized anxiety disorder, life; Any substance use disorder (alcohol or drug), life; Any substance use disorder (alcohol or drug), 12 months; Alcohol abuse or dependence, life; Alcohol abuse or dependence, 12 months; Cannabis use, life; Self-rated work stress, days a bit stressful; Self-rated work stress, days not at all or not very stressful; Perceived need for mental health care, no need; Perceived need for mental health care, all needs met; Perceived mental health, very good or excellent; Perceived mental health, good; Post-traumatic stress disorder, current diagnosed condition; Eating disorder, current diagnosed condition; and Attention deficit disorder, current diagnosed condition."
